Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION
1.	Introduction

1.1.	Introduction – This document is meant as a final report for the project “Sahayog – A Crowd-funding and donation platform”. In this report we will precisely present all the details required to build this software and also functional requirement, ER diagrams and scope in detail.

Sahayog is a platform where a user can get their funding or investments very easily compared to the market’s currently running products which has a very complicated UI designs and not very easy to understand web applications to the user.

Sahayog tries to solve all this problem by doing proper research in UI/UX and understanding what a user wants in his/her application to get the start very easily.


1.2.	Literature Review – In past there have been various reports and research papers about crowdfunding and donation platforms which helps to understand user’s perspective of how intuitive the application should be held.

Some of the research paper used for this project are: -

F. Kleemann, G. Vob, and K. Rieder, “Un (der) paid Innovators: The Commercial Utilization of Consumer Work through Crowdsourcing,” Science Technology and Innovation Studies, vol. 4, pp. 5-26, 2008.

The essence of crowdsourcing, as de-fined here, is the intentional mobiliza-tion for commercial exploitation of creative ideas and other forms of work performed by consumers. Other Web 2.0 based activities that do not inte-grate users into a firm's value creation process are related but peripheral to

P. Belleflamme, T. Lambert, and A. Schwienbacher, “Crowdfunding: Tapping the Right Crowd,” in   International Conference of the French Finance Association (AFFI), May 11- 13, 2011, 2011.

We have used website’s like behance.net by adobe and dribbble.com to understand the minimalistic designs of UI/UX for the user for better understanding and reach of our product to the user.

1.3.	Problem Definition – The problem we seek to address by our product is to help user in emergency when they need help to raise funds by not keeping the UI very complicated and just providing them with a platform which asks very less information to get started. The products which are currently in the market has very complex UI/UX to get through the user to understand and then user feels helpless during his/her tough times so we understood the physiology of the user to develop this product and solve it in the best way possible.
There are also some problems with payment, transaction not happening in time or being provide to the user. It takes T+1 Days to reach to the current user, so we directly collect the money in the user’s account. There is so time delay for the money transition.
